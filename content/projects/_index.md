### 2020

**[Summer Research Scholarship](green-edge)** <br>
I participated in the Summer Research scholarship program at the university of Waikato.

**[COMPX241 - Smoke and Mirrors](https://github.com/tachyonicClock/gothello)** <br>
Gothello is a combination of the games of "Go" and "Othello". Made as part of a 
two man team in 2020 for a university paper. I have continued adding to it and updating it.
The most notable enhancement is that it now includes an advanced [MiniMax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax) AI.

### 2019
**[NCEA Level 3 - Technology Scholarship - "*Theasthai*" (Complex Website)](theasthai)** <br>
A Website built using react, golang, mongodb, and graphql. This was my entry for the NCEA technology scholarship. I was awarded an NCEA scholarship for this work.

### 2018
**[NCEA Level 2 - "*Blue*" (Unity Game)](blue)** <br>
A simple stealth game where you try to escape some monsters. Completely custom ai, graphics, models, and soundtrack.

### 2017
[**NCEA Level 1 - "*MAD*" (C# Strategy Game)**](mad) <br>
One of my very first projects. Made in C# leveraging the amazing (thats sarcasm) power of windows forms for a strategic strategy game.
