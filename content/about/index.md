Following an internship I worked part-time at Nyriad as a software engineer on the Escalate project that combined blockchain with cloud storage and computing. The project was based on a microservice architecture. At nyriad I primarily programmed in C++ and Golang. I gained proficiency in using technologies such as containerization in the form of docker and some Kubernetes. I also developed skills in continuous deployment using Jenkins and writing tests.
